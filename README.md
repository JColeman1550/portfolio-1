# Julian's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 

## Projects

### Personal Web Development Blog
Built with React and CSS, this blog serves as both a portfolio and a journal of my growth as a developer. I document my learning experiences, challenges, and coding journey. It’s a space where I reflect on my progress and share insights from my projects and industry events.

### Job Hitlist
This job-tracking web app, built with React, helps users stay organized during their job search. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter job listings, keeping track of company details and application statuses. I focused on building a clean UI with state management using React’s `useState`, making the app intuitive and easy to use.

### ThrowTrack
Designed to help youth pitchers track their pitching sessions, this app is built with JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js. The goal is to promote healthy pitching practices by tracking key metrics like pitch count, ball/strike ratio, and pitch location. It’s an interactive tool for coaches and parents to monitor pitching performance and prevent overuse injuries.

### Flashcard Trivia Game
An interactive trivia game built with React and Axios. Users can select categories, customize the number of questions, and test their knowledge. The game is mobile-responsive and includes light/dark mode for an improved user experience. It fetches trivia questions via the Open Trivia Database API and displays them as flashcards.
